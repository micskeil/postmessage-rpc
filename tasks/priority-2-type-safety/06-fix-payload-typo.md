# Fix "playload" Typo in Type Definition

## Priority: TYPE SAFETY
**Status:** 🟡 Type Safety Issue

## Location
`src/initPlugin.ts:3`

## Problem
The `Method` type has a typo in the parameter name: "playload" instead of "payload".

```typescript
// Line 3 - ❌ Typo
type Method = (playload: unknown) => Promise<unknown>;
```

## Impact
- Inconsistent naming throughout codebase
- Confusing for developers
- May cause confusion when implementing methods
- Unprofessional code quality

## Solution

Fix the typo:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
type Method = (payload: unknown) => Promise<unknown>;
```

## Files to Modify
- `src/initPlugin.ts`

## Search for Related Issues
Check if this typo appears anywhere else in the codebase:
```bash
grep -r "playload" src/
```

## Testing
After fixing:
1. Run `npm run build` - TypeScript should compile without errors
2. Run `npm run lint` - No linting issues
3. Run `npm test` - All tests should pass
4. Search codebase to ensure no references to the old typo remain

## Related Issues
- None (isolated typo)

## Notes
While this is a minor issue, fixing typos improves code quality and professionalism. It's especially important in a library that will be used by other developers.
